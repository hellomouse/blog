# Intuition
{/* Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. */}

Let your number of *chances* to test be $$\lfloor{\text{minutesToTest} / \text{minutesToDie}}\rfloor$$. Let's see if we can derive any patterns.

### *One* Pig Case
Suppose you had one pig and one chance at testing. You can test at most 2 buckets (if the pig doesn't die drinking bucket #1 then it's bucket #2).

Now suppose you had 2 chances at testing. Now you can test at most 3 buckets by testing the first two buckets (if neither are poison the third one must be.)

So for one pig, the number of buckets we can test is $\text{chances} + 1$

### More Pigs

Suppose we had one chance at testing and two pigs. We can test 4 buckets by:
1. Buckets 1, 2 go to pig 1
2. Buckets 1, 3 go to pig 2

We can think of arranging the buckets in a $(\text{chances} + 1) \times (\text{chances} + 1)$ matrix:

```
1 2
3 4
```

Where pig 1 is fed the first $\text{chances}$ rows row by row and pig 2 is fed the first $\text{chances}$ columns column by column. 

Note the pigs are independent, each individual pig is the same as the one-pig case! That means every pig can individually identify a single coordinate the poisoned bucket is in (in this example, pig 1 identifies the row coordinate and pig 2 the column coordinate, put together gives you the coordinate of the poisoned bucket)

### Larger Example

Let's assume we have `2 chances` and 3 pigs. We can index up to 27 buckets, as shown in the $3 \times 3 \times 3$ cube below:

```
(Top layer)   (Middle Layer)    (Bottom layer)
   1 2 3          10 11 12          19 20 21
   4 5 6          13 14 15          22 23 24
   7 8 9          16 17 18          25 26 27
```

For indexing, let's assume the top/bottom dimension is z and is last (0 indexed), so for example given `buckets[x][y][z]` we have `buckets[0][0][0] = 1` and `buckets[0][2][1] = 12` (This is just for convention, it's not important to understand the solution)

On the first chance:
1. Pig 1 is fed `1,2,3,  10,11,12,  19,20,21` (x=0 slice)
2. Pig 2 is fed `1,4,7,  10,13,16,  19,22,25` (y=0 slice)
3. Pig 3 is fed `1,2,3,  4,5,6,    7,8,9` (z=0 slice)

On the second chance:
1. Pig 1 is fed `4,5,6,  13,14,15,  22,23,24` (x=1 slice)
2. Pig 2 is fed `2,5,8,  11,14,17,  20,23,26` (y=1 slice)
3. Pig 3 is fed `10,11,12,  13,14,15,  16,17,18` (z=1 slice)

Suppose the poison was at `buckets[2,1,0] = 8`. Then:
1. The 1st pig does not die, so poison must have `x=2`
2. The 2nd pig dies when testing `y=1`, so poison has `y=1`
3. The 3rd pig dies when testing `z=0`, so poison has `z=0`

Hopefully this helps you understand how this indexing can help locate the poisoned bucket.

### Math

The number of buckets that can be indexed is $(\text{chances} + 1)^{\text{pigs}}$, so we want to find $\text{pigs}$ where $(\text{chances} + 1)^{\text{pigs}} = \text{buckets}$, which is simply $\lceil log_{\text{chances} + 1}(\text{buckets}) \rceil$ (Ceiling since we can't have fractional pigs)


# Approach
Compute the log. We use the log change of base formula in the code since C++ doesn't have an arbitrary base log function.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: Whatever the time complexity of $log(x)$ is
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        return ceil(log2(buckets) / log2(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1));
    }
};
```
