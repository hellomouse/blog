This is a demonstration of the `jsx2jsx` compiler. The value is currently {value()}.

This is a button. <button onClick={() => setValue(v => v + 1)}>Increment</button>

# Title: Paying people to work on Open Source is good, actually

This post is a response to [*Paying people to work on open source is good actually*, at jacobian.org](https://jacobian.org/2024/feb/16/paying-maintainers-is-good/). In that post, the author argues that we ought to pay people who work on open source. I fully agree, with one notable exception.

> Note the deliberate use of lower case. I'm not referring to Open Source™ as defined by OSI, nor to Free Software™ as defined by the FSF. I mean these terms in the broadest, most inclusive sense: "software with source code that I can read and modify and release variants of, perhaps under some conditions."

There is no discomfort to be had for one simple reason: I do not particularly care about "pseudo-open source".

# Proprietary software is not open source

Let's talk about Microsoft® Windows™. Under the OSI definition of "open source", Windows is clearly *not* open source. Windows is, however, source-available, under the Enterprise Source Licensing Program[^windows-ssi-note].

[^windows-ssi-note]: It should be noted that there are other programs under the Shared Source Initiative, including for OEMs and MVPs (Microsoft's Most Valuable Professionals™).

> The Enterprise Source Licensing Program (ESLP) licenses Microsoft Windows source code to qualified enterprise customers. The ESLP provides source code for most major releases and service packs of Windows (client and server).

Source-available software is proprietary software, and proprietary software is not open source. This isn't really controversial. Software companies do not advertise source-available software as open source software because that would be false advertising. Companies who transitioned away from open source to a source-available license likewise dropped the term "open source" from their websites and documentation.

But what if someone wanted to write some source-available software and then make money off of it? Simple![^sell-software] They would simply market it and sell it, just like any other proprietary software. There's software-as-a-service, per-user licensing, per-machine licensing, per-core licensing, per-year licensing, per-planetary syzygy licensing, per-moon-like superweapon licensing, free but you give us all your data licensing, etc. There is practically no limit to how you can monetize proprietary software. After all, it is literally illegal for people to use your software without your permission.

[^sell-software]: Maybe not *that* simple, because you still need to get people to like your software. You'd need the same in open source as well, though.

# Open source software is not proprietary

Open source software differs from proprietary software by granting you rights by default. There is no contract to sign and no EULA you must agree to. 

- open source may be forked
- open source is often foundational
- if the EU or some other government decides to sponsor open source, they should not sponsor "pseudo-open source"

## Open source projects are often communities

> People who consider the BSL to be open source are assholes trying to destroy communities, plain and simple, tbh.

> &mdash; an unattributed individual on IRC

- about the "bait and switch"
- unequal licenses, such as CLAs or BSL, are incompatible with communities

## The open/proprietary relationship is deeply inequal

- proprietary software overwhelmingly requires open source software to function
- open source cannot reasonably require proprietary components

## Open source projects are practically immortal

- gone bankrupt? no problem!

# Purity is required for the preservation of open source

It is not a "win" for "open source" when projects adopt proprietary licenses, because then they aren't open source anymore. It may be a win for the developers, but even then, it is a win for proprietary software.

Open source directly benefits society by its nature of being open. Close down open source with "pseudo-open source" licenses and you don't get that anymore. 

# Conclusion

I do not claim to have the ultimate solution for the improvement of the lives of open source maintainers. There are many initiatives, such as the US National Science Foundation's [POSE program](https://new.nsf.gov/tip/updates/nsf-invests-over-26m-open-source-projects) and the [NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/), which aim to fund open source projects. We ought to have more of these. Foundational projects, such as the Linux kernel or compilers, ought to be funded similarly to scientific research.

Yet in order to do this, we must clearly identify what is and isn't "open source". Open source software *directly* benefits society. Proprietary software, on the other hand, *might* benefit society. Open source software needs all the help it can get, for improvements are freely available and benefit everyone. Proprietary software is fully capable of supporting itself. If not, maybe they should consider being an open source project instead.
